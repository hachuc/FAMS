Annual Depreciation Expense		=	Cost of fixed Asset - Scrap Value
									---------------------------------
											Life Span (Years)
											
Life span : 5
Purchase Cost : 17000
Salvage Value : 2000

	ADE = (17000 - 2000) / 5 = 3000
	
Book Value = Original Cost - Accumulated Depreciation

---------------------------------------------------------

If the vehicle were to be sold and the sales price exceeded 
the depreciated value (net book value) then the excess would be 
considered a gain and subject to depreciation recapture. 

In addition, this gain above the depreciated value would be recognized 
as ordinary income by the tax office. If the sales price is ever less 
than the book value, the resulting capital loss is tax deductible. 
If the sale price were ever more than the original book value, 
then the gain above the original book value is recognized as a capital gain.

If a company chooses to depreciate an asset at a different rate from that 
used by the tax office then this generates a timing difference in the income 
statement due to the difference (at a point in time) between the taxation 
department's and company's view of the profit.
